<p>You may also be curious when does a hotel charge your debit card. Also no hotel unless it�s a shady motel will rent for a few hours. When booking a reservation for a hotel room, a guest may be asked to make an advance deposit, which is money paid, usually by check or credit card, by a guest that is generally equal to one night�s lodging fees.
