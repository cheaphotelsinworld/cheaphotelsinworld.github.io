<p>You can book a hotel room for someone else using your credit card, as long as you list that person as the guest when booking. In most of our hotels, you can pay in cash or by credit/debit card (unless otherwise mentioned in the hotel page or offer) you can pay with a different credit card than the one used when booking. Paying with a card is not the problem i dont understand why you have to pay a cash deposit with a credit or debit card why cant you just pay cash for the deposit and if you mess anything up they can keep it. The reason has to do with liability for additional charges or damages caused by the guest. All locations accept american express, diners, discover/novus, mastercard, visa, debit cards, drury hotels gift certificates, and cash with credit card verification.</p>

<p>Typically, you cannot make a hotel reservation with cash, a personal check or a money order. The hotel is not charging you twice—if you booked anywhere but through the hotel�s official site, you haven�t been charged yet for those fees when you stroll up to the reception desk; So those services might be denied until a form of payment is given. Thank you for your question. Whether you should use cash when paying for an uber ride is a completely different matter to ponder.</p>

<p>Hmmm, will the hotel take a cheque. Paypal is a popular method of online payment, because you do not need to provide your credit card information to yet another website. In fact , you dont pay anything using booking.com upon reservation and the payment by default is automatic in cash in the hotel and you can cancel the reservation free of charge prior to arrival with 24 hours , the credit card is needed because on case of no show they debit the first night from it , unless it is mention clearly on the reservation and beside the price that it is non. You can ask to pay a deposit in cash. I just think the deposit with the card is.</p>
