        <p><strong>The doors morrison hotel full album</strong>. When the group returned with diltz and approached the desk. On their fifth album, the doors abandoned experimental dalliances for the raw, sonic crunch of electric blues that had defined them in the first place. 50th anniversary deluxe edition 2cd/1lp includes the original album newly remastered by the doors’ longtime engineer and mixer bruce botnick, plus a bonus disc of unreleased. Not just a band photo, but the band posing like a shot from some wicked �70s thriller.</p>
